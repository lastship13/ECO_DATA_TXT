              <ns0:String>Cotton seedlings were used in phytotoxicity screening of phthalimide and 15 N-substituted derivatives. The seedlings were severely injured. To determine the target of this phytotoxicity ATPase isolated from wheat seedling roots was incubated with the phthalimides. Most of the phtha1imides had no significant irihibitory effect on ATPase activity. Further studies in which diamine oxidase iso1ated from wheat root tissues was incubated with the herbicides produced a good correlation between phytotoxic injury and degree of DAO inhibition. Since it is known that amine oxidases are involved in the biosynthesis of the plant hormnone indoleacetate it is suggested that these DAO inhibitors act by affecting plant growth regulation.</ns0:String>
